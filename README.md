Crazy 8s card game in Java

Creating a crazy 8s card game in Java focusing on effective use of OOP. First project with suggestions and guidance by mentor Andrew @ Electric Hive.
Starting off as a text based, two player version. The plan is to tie it to a GUI framework and get it running in chromium and safari in order to play between many architectures.
MVP: Two players, single 52 card deck, crazy 8s rules, graphic representation of cards, a winner, playable on chromium and safari.
